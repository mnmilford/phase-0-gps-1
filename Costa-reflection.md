# Costa Reflections

What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
 * The concept of merging was something I did not fully grasp or even have a guess as to how it would work.
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
 * Appropriately, I now have seen the merge process in action.
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
 * We asked the guide about the concept of local cloning or network cloning. We also asked about the difference between pull and fetch / merge
What still confuses you about Git?
 * Reverting back to certain commit stages is still something I have not had exposure to.
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
 * The first experience was good. I enjoyed the style of the guide and I enjoyed working with my pair, Michael.
