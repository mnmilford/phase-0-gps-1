# GPS 1 Reflection

&nbsp;

**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

I struggled a bit with how many steps are actually involved in the proper Git workflow. Also, I'm still not *100%* comfortable with the options available on GitHub.com, but I'm at a much better place now. It will just take more practice.

&nbsp;

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

Not a git concept, but I learned how to pair using Hangouts, which will be helpful in the future. The git related concept that was clarified was how to handle merge conflicts. We handled a very basic merge conflict, but now I understand the process of correcting, re-adding, and committing a file.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

Throughout the pairing session, we relied on the navigator to provide feedback on the various command line steps. We asked our guide (Matt Higgins) about the `git clone` command. We were curious if you could clone a repository with a directory location rather than a URL.

We also asked Matt questions about reverting to previous commits. He explained there are two schools of thought: 1. To literally delete commits and go back to the previous one 2. Just add a new commit of the files/info on the commit you want to return to. The second way makes sense if the error prone commits were already made public.

**What still confuses you about Git?**

The Git documentation is still a bit overwhelming. I feel like I have a really good grasp on the basic commands, but not all the possible variations. I'm confident that I can read through the documentation and test them out as I go along.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

Like the other pairing sessions, it was good to see how my progress compares to other cohort-members. It was VERY helpful to have a guide to provide more in-depth knowledge on certain topics. Really, it helps save time that might have been spent Googling instead of getting a personal explanation.
